## 🌏 Digital Image Processing
Simple image processing projects using opencv with python

>## 1. Batman logo 

In the first one we convert a colored picture of batman to Black-Whtie picture. In addition we write "BATMAN" in the bottom of the batman.

import RGB image and with thresholding make it white and black then
